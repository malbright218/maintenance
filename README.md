# My Movie List

### Description
What exactly is My Movie List? Is it a copy of My Anime List? No, definitely not. Is the landing page similiar to Anilist? No, never heard of them. Anyway, My Movie List is a group project created with 4 other members that lets you store movies that you watched, plan to watch, or completed into MongoDB. Keep track of all the movies that you have watched in your lifetime, along with a score.
